<p>
  First I have to create a new deck with the endpoint located at
  <code>https://deckofcardsapi.com/api/deck/new/</code>.
  The query returns some json with a <code>deck_id</code> that I can use
  for future requests. Maybe I can make a widget where clicking a
  button draws a new card from this deck.
